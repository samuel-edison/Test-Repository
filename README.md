## Guidelines:
#### One repository per report or analysis project
#### Repository name should align with report name
#### Creating a folder: click "create file". Type your folders name then at the end of the name type "/" to initialize it as a folder. After this, you can create a new file in that folder by hitting "/" again and typing a file name with extension ".md"

## Workflow:
