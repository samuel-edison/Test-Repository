# Template Repository

## Guidelines:
* One repository per report or analysis project
* Repository name should align with report name
* Creating a folder: click "create file". Type your folders name then at the end of the name type "/" to initialize it as a folder. After this, you can create a new file in that folder by hitting "/" again and typing a file name with extension ".md"
* The ".md" stands for markdown formatted. Markdown is a markup language. With it you can easily display headers or have italic words, or bold or almost anything that can be done to text

## Typical Project Workflow:
* Retrieve/Create Business Documentation
* Complete Exploratory Analysis
* Follow up with stakeholders on scope
* Finalize Business Requirements
* Begin Build / Document Technical Requirements
